# GitHub Workflow Evaluation (100 Marks)

## Summary Score: 95/100

- Repository Setup: 20/20
- Revision Tracking (Commits): 35/35
- Branching & Merging: 40/45

## Evidence Collected
- Public repository exists: `AkshatTm/OS-CA-Real-Time-Process-Monitoring-Dashboard`.
- Commits span Nov 25 → Nov 30, 2025, with frequent pushes and clear messages.
- Examples:
  - `feat: Hybrid Rust + Python backend implementation`
  - `docs: Complete documentation overhaul and GitHub community standards`
  - `Merge pull request #7 from AkshatTm/rust-implementation`
  - Multiple contributors: `AkshatTm`, `priyanshukamal26`, `Kulvinder`.
- Pull requests and merges observed: `#2`, `#3`, `#4`, `#5`, `#6`, `#7`, `#8`.

## Assessment vs Requirements
- Create a repository: Met (20/20).
- Maintain at least 7 revisions with clear commit messages: Met, significantly more than 7, messages largely descriptive (35/35).
- Use branches for features and merge after testing: Mostly met. Dedicated branches like `rust-implementation`, `Documentation-Update`, `feature/updates` merged via PRs. A few direct commits to `main` exist; overall good practice (40/45).

## Suggested Improvements
- Adopt a conventional commit style across all contributors for consistency.
- Require PR reviews (even peer reviews) before merging; enable branch protection for `main`.
- Add CI (GitHub Actions) for lint/test on PRs.
- Link issues to PRs for traceability and add brief PR descriptions listing changes and test notes.

## Conclusion
All three workflow requirements are satisfied: repository created, >7 revisions with clear messages, and branching + PR merges used. Minor improvements would make the workflow exemplary.
